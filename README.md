# Pre Requisite before executing the code
1. When executing the code please copy the configuration file config_weather.py 
to the folder where the code is being executed. This file contains the api Key from 
openweathermap.

# Interpretation of Latitude and Temperature:
Please refer to LatsvsTemp.png. It is apparent that the temperatues are the higher as the Latitude approaches zero(Equator). 
Temperatures are the lowest at the extremes ends of the plot. i.e at the poles. This is pretty much in line with what I remember from Middle School. 

# Interpretation of Latitude and Humidity:
Please refer to LatsvsHum.png. There is not much of a corelation between the 2 variables, but one can observe that the humidity is 
definitely high in citoes close to the equator.

# Interpretation of Latitude and Wind Speed:
Please refer to WindSpeedvsLatitude.png. One can observe that as you move further from the equator the Wind Sppeds tend to increase. 
The wind speed is the least in places closer to the equator and tends to increase as we move farther in either direction either North or South. There is no definitive correaltion between Latitude and Wind Speed , but winds speeds tend to get higher in cities farther from the equator.
